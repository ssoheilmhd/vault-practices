# Vault Migration Scripts

## Introduction

In Vault service, different storage methodologies exist, and migrating data between these storage backends (e.g., from Consul to Raft) can be challenging. Additionally, when upgrading from very old versions to much newer ones, data migration becomes complex due to potential database migrations between application versions.

These scripts provide a solution by accessing the Vault service at the application layer to extract critical information from the source and restore it to the specified destination.

> **Note**: These scripts are designed specifically for ASA's usage patterns and do not cover all possible scenarios.

## Features

- **Backup**: Captures secrets, policies, and user bindings from source Vault
- **Restore**: Restores data to destination Vault with identical structure
- **User Management**: Handles user/password authentication with policy bindings

## Prerequisites

- Vault CLI installed and configured
- Appropriate permissions for Vault tokens
- Access to both source and destination Vault clusters

## File Structure

├── general-vault-backup.sh
├── general-vault-restore.sh
├── user.json (to be created by user)
├── backup_secrets/ (generated by backup script)
├── backup_policies/ (generated by backup script)
└── backup_users/ (generated by backup script)

## Backup from Old Vault

The backup script captures the following information:

- **Secrets**: Only secrets created on the kv2 engine (all secrets in staging were created this way)
- **Policies**: All policies defined for paths
- **User's Bind Policies**: For each user, captures which policies were assigned to them

### Usage

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=<source_vault_address>
export VAULT_TOKEN=<source_vault_token>
./general-vault-backup.sh

{
  "user1": "pass1",
  "user2": "pass2",
  "user3": "pass3"
}

### Restoring Informations


After completing the backup steps, run the restore script in the same directory. This script will update the new Vault based on the generated outputs.

The restore script performs the following operations on the new Vault:

    Secrets: Restores secrets with the exact same hierarchy as the source

    Policies: Copies all path policies exactly

    User/Pass Auth Method: Automatically enables this method

    User/Pass: Registers user/password information from the user.json file

    User's Bind Policies: Assigns the appropriate policies to each user

Usage
bash

export VAULT_ADDR=<destination_vault_address>
export VAULT_TOKEN=<destination_vault_token>
./general-vault-restore.sh

### Testing

The above documentation has been tested on migration from Vault version 1.14.8 to 1.20.3 with successful results. Please note that significant investment has been made in the Vault command behavior within these scripts, so careful attention should be paid to the source version, target version, and system Vault command version.
